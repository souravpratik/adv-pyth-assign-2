    "Solution:  A module in python is simply a way to organize the code, and it contains either python classes or just functions. If            we need those classes or functions in our project, we just import them. For example, the math module in python                  contains just a bunch of functions, and we just call those are needed."

There is another way to do it, which uses the \"__init__\" method. It’s a constructor method that is automatically               called after an instance of a class has been created."
